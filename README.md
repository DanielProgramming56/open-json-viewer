JSON Hierarchy Viewer
Overview
Welcome to the JSON Hierarchy Viewer â€“ an open-source tool designed to receive JSON input and generate a hierarchical representation of its structure. This viewer transforms JSON objects into a structured format, making it easier to understand the hierarchy of the data.

How It Works
The viewer takes a JSON input, such as {"name": "Daniel"}, and produces an output in the following format:

json
Copy code
[
  {
    "id": "name",
    "parent": null,
    "value": "Daniel"
  }
]
In this output, each element represents a node in the hierarchy. The properties include:

id: The key or property name in the JSON object.
parent: The parent node in the hierarchy. For the root node, this is null.
value: The value associated with the key in the JSON object.
